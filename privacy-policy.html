<h2 id="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</h2>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Influx Inc, (“Influx”, “we”, “us”, “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy. We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe to you our practices regarding personal information we collect from users of our Site and Services (as defined in the Terms of Use). Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings given in our <a href="terms-of-service.html">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
<p>The processing of Personal Data shall always be in line with the Australian Privacy Principles contained in the Privacy Act 1998 (“Privacy Act”), the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), and in accordance with country-specific data protection regulations applicable to Influx.</p>
<p>We have implemented a number of technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of Personal Data processed through the Site.</p>
<p>For the purpose of the GDPR:</p>
<ul>
<li>In respect of the Personal Data of the Website and the Services the Data Controller is Influx;</li>
<li>In respect of Personal Data of end users or organisations of clients that use our Services, Influx may also process Personal Data on behalf of its clients as a data processor. When working as a data processor Influx will be acting on the instructions of its client and will work hard to ensure that the client is fully GDPR compliant. You will need to review the privacy policy of that client as in this instance they will be the data controller, and we will only process Personal Data on behalf of our clients in accordance with their instructions and not for our own purposes. Similarly, where we act as a data processor Influx has no direct control over the data collected by its clients. This means that you should contact the client with any data controller requests.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the purpose of the Privacy Act, when we act a data processor no “disclosure” of Personal Data has been made to us.</p>
<h3 id="user-consent">User Consent</h3>
<p>Where we rely on your consent as the lawful basis to process your data we will always ask for you to positively affirm your acceptance. By clicking “I accept the Privacy Policy” or similar, or if we indicate that by clicking a button you are accepting this Privacy Policy you acknowledge and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We note that certain contact or other data forms where consent is required to be given by you include no pre-checked checkboxes so that you are able to freely affirmatively opt-in. In cases where we do not consider it practical to include a checkbox, we will indicate that by clicking a certain button you have agreed to the terms of this Privacy Policy. We will also provide you with notice on the Site specifically detailing what it is that you are consenting to in clear and plain language as well ensuring that each matter that requires consent is clearly distinguishable.</p>
<p>For all areas of the Site where consent is given it is just as easily able to be withdrawn through the appropriate account settings on the Site.</p>
<p>If you believe that consent has not been given freely or in breach of the terms of this Privacy Policy please contact us.</p>
<h3 id="children">Children</h3>
<p>Our service is not offered to persons under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from such visitors without parental or guardian consent and require our clients to fully comply with applicable law in the data collected from children under the age of 13.</p>
<p>If you become aware that a child has provided us with information please contact us. Any information that is in breach of this provision will be deleted.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-data-we-collect">Types of data we collect</h3>

<p>There is no application fee for making a request to access your personal information.

<p>Where we act as a data processor, we do so on behalf of our client and in accordance with their instructions.

<h3 id="security-of-your-personal-data">Security of your personal data</h3>
<p>Influx is committed to protecting the security of your Personal Data. We (and our third party service providers) use a variety of industry-standard security technologies and procedures to help protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We also require you to enter a password to access your Account information. Please do not disclose your Account password to unauthorized people. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while Influx uses reasonable efforts to protect your Personal Data, Influx cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<h3 id="international-transfer-and-disclosure-of-personal-data">International transfer and disclosure of personal data</h3>
<p>Where we transfer Personal Data outside of the European Union or EFTA States, we ensure an adequate level of protection for the rights of data subjects based on the adequacy of the receiving country’s data protection laws.</p>
<p>We may disclose personal information to our related bodies corporate and third party suppliers and service providers located overseas for some of the purposes listed above. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the overseas recipients of your personal information do not breach the privacy obligations relating to your personal information.</p>
<p>We may disclose your personal information to entities located outside of America, including the following:
- our related bodies corporate;
- our data hosting and other IT service providers, located in various countries; and
- other third parties located in various foreign countries, such as our contractors in Africa, Asia and other foreign jurisdictions.</p>
<p>We may disclose your personal information to entities who may store or process your data overseas.</p>
<p>Where we act as a data processor Influx complies with our client’s requests in respect of how we deal with end customer data.</p>
<h3 id="notifiable-data-breaches">Notifiable data breaches</h3>
<p>We take data breaches very seriously. Depending on where you reside our policy is:</p>
<h4 id="if-you-reside-in-australia">1. If you reside in Australia:</h4>
<p>In the event that there is a data breach and we are required to comply with the notification of eligible data breaches provisions in Part IIIC of the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) or any other subsequent sections or legislation which supersede this Part IIIC, we will take all reasonable steps to contain the suspected or known breach where possible and follow the following process set out in this clause.</p>
<p>We will take immediate steps to limit any further access or distribution where possible. If we have reasonable grounds to suspect that the data breach is likely to result in serious harm to any individuals involved, then we will take all reasonable steps to ensure an assessment is completed within 30 days of the breach or sooner if possible. We will follow the guide published by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (if any) in making this assessment.</p>
<p>If we reasonably determine that the data breach is not likely to result in serious harm to any individuals involved or any remedial action we take is successful in making serious harm no longer likely, then no notification or statement will be made.</p>
<p>Where, following an assessment and undertaking remedial action (if any), we still have reasonable grounds to believe serious harm is likely, as soon as practicable, we will provide a statement to each of the individuals whose data was breached or who are at risk. The statement will contain details of the breach and recommendations of the steps each individual should take. We will also provide a copy of the statement to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.</p>
<h4 id="if-you-reside-in-the-european-union-of-efta-states">2. If you reside in the European Union of EFTA States:</h4>
<p>We will endeavour to meet the 72 hour deadline as imposed by the GDPR, to report any data breach to the supervisory authority where a data breach occurs that will likely be a risk to you.</p>
<p>Further, where there is likely to be a high risk to your rights we will endeavour to contact you without undue delay.</p>
<p>We will review every incident and take action to prevent future breaches.</p>
<h3 id="automated-individual-decision-making-including-profiling">Automated individual decision-making, including profiling</h3>
<p>If you reside in the European Union or EFTA States, you shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning you, or similarly significantly affects you, as long as the decision is not necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between us, or is not authorized by Union or Member State law to which we are subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard your rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, or is not based on your explicit consent. If you wish to exercise your rights please contact us.</p>
<h3 id="retention-of-data">Retention of Data</h3>
<p>We keep personal information from active accounts as long as it is reasonably needed for our operations and to fulfill the purposes set out herein. We will also keep personal information from accounts that have been deactivated where we are legally required to and also where it is necessary to stop fraud, collect outstanding fees, troubleshoot problems, or otherwise enforce our other policies accessible on the Site.</p>
