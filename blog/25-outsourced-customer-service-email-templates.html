<p>For the benefit of your future (product/service/subscription), we may need to troubleshoot this a little further — feel free to try these out and see if they work:</p>
<p>- Force quit app -&gt; reopen -&gt; log back in</p>
<p>- Uninstall app -&gt; reinstall -&gt; log back in</p>
<p>- Restart phone/turn phone off then on</p>
<p>- Your phone’s software itself should be fully updated (Android or iOS)</p>
<p>- We update the (Product) app as often as possible to make it faster and more reliable for you.</p>
<p>We’ve seen a lot of similar cases resolve when the above actions are taken. In the meantime, if you’re still experiencing technical setbacks, I will gather a little more info about your phone to ensure our engineering teams can take the next steps with a fix :)</p>

<p>Hi (Customer),</p>
<p>Thanks for getting in touch.</p>
<p>I am sorry to hear that the charge took you by surprise. When you initially subscribed, this triggered a 7-day trial, and as you didn’t opt-out from this, the full annual amount was charged.</p>
<p>If you don’t wish to take advantage of this, you can contact Apple directly via (website link). I’m afraid that we can only manage payments that were made via our website. Only Apple can help with payment-related questions for iTunes purchases, as they don’t allow developers to access or edit their users’ subscription settings.</p>
<p>I am very sorry that we are not able to provide a better solution for you and hope the above helps. Please let me know if you have any further questions about your subscription, or if I can do anything else to help.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>Thanks for writing in. We’re happy to refund the charge completely but hope that you might consider maintaining your subscription.</p>
<p>What do you say if we offer you a 20% discount for this billing period? I would adjust the current charge and send a refund of the difference. Looking forward to your feedback!</p>

<p>Hi (Customer),</p>
<p>This is (your name), one of the Team Leaders in (your company). (Initial agent’s name) has forwarded your email to me.</p>
<p>Firstly, I’d like to express how sorry I am for the confusion with your order. It appears that your order had been returned since our courier partner was unable to complete the delivery due to an incorrect/insufficient address.</p>
<p>I agree with you that you have paid for the express delivery within the 2-days window and had updated your new address. But our courier partner did not receive the address update in time and returned your package to our delivery hub to ensure its safety.</p>
<p>We understand how frustrating this must be and I would like to offer you a free of charge redelivery for this order.</p>
<p>I hope this helps and once again I am sorry for the inconvenience this has caused. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to reach out.</p>
<p>All the best,</p>

<p>Hi (Customer),</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting (company) customer care.</p>
<p>We are sorry about the confusion regarding your subscription. The XYZ subscription with a 14-day free trial was accepted as part of your sign-up for the subscription. Unfortunately, as you did not cancel within the 14-day free trial period, and there was no contact made before this correspondence, the subscription was renewed for its paid period after the trial ended.</p>
<p>Although we don’t generally process any refunds for canceled pre-paid subscriptions, we have reviewed your account and refunded the charges to you, as a courtesy for our valued customer. We have also gone ahead and canceled this subscription to ensure that there will be no future charges. Please note that it may take 5-7 business days for the money to be reflected on your bank statement depending on your financial institution.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this helps. Please let us know if there’s anything else we can help you with.</p>
<p>Thank you for your understanding.</p>

<p>Hi (Customer),</p>
<p>Thanks for writing in. I see that you subscribed via iTunes. We do not manage these payments and can only offer discounts for purchases made via our website - this is why we never link to app stores in our offers.</p>
<p>I’m afraid we are unable to apply for a partial refund for this, but here’s what you can do: deactivate your current subscription’s auto-renew function within iTunes and re-subscribe after expiration through our website with the code ‘30off’ - this will apply a 30% discount on the first billing period via the website.</p>
<p>Here’s a guide on how to deactivate the auto-renewal in your app store: (guide/link).</p>
<p>I’m sorry if our communication hasn’t been clear enough in this regard and hope that the offer is a good compromise for you.</p>
